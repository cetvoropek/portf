🔥 CLAUDE PROMPT — PREMIUM PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
ROLE & MINDSET
You are a world-class creative technologist, Apple-level product designer, and senior front-end engineer.
You design experiences that feel like macOS / iOS system software meets cinematic storytelling.
You are building a personal portfolio website for a developer-founder who builds serious products, not hobby projects.
This site must feel:
Exclusive
Calm but powerful
System-native (macOS-like)
Visually unforgettable
Technically impressive
No generic layouts. No startup clichés. No “hero + 3 cards + testimonials” nonsense.
🎯 GOAL OF THE WEBSITE
Create a portfolio that instantly signals:
“This person builds real systems, real businesses, and real products.”
The visitor should feel:
“This feels like Apple”
“This person is on another level”
“I want to hire them / work with them / trust them”
🧠 CORE PROJECTS TO FEATURE (REAL, SERIOUS PRODUCTS)
You must design the site around these products, each treated like a mini product launch page:
1. Digital Permit Book
Fleet compliance platform for trucking companies
Features:
DOT / permits / vehicle docs
Offline-first
Inspector-ready UI
Real-world compliance pain solving
Tone: industrial, serious, trusted
2. TruckRecruit / ChatterHire
AI-assisted recruiting & chatter evaluation platform
Features:
Candidate screening
Custom tests (typing speed, creativity, English)
Admin-only dashboard
Decision-making automation
Tone: sharp, efficient, modern
3. Construction / Business Expense App
Advanced cost-tracking app (workers, salaries, fuel, margins)
Features:
Worker profiles
Real profit visibility
Charts that expose waste
“CEO-level clarity”
Tone: clean, analytical, confident
4. Impulse Purchase Firewall App
Psychological decision-blocking app
Features:
48-hour purchase lock
Questioning impulses
Brutally honest feedback
Behavioral design
Tone: minimal, bold, slightly provocative
🖥️ DESIGN LANGUAGE (VERY IMPORTANT)
Overall Style
macOS Sonoma / Sequoia vibe
Liquid Glass
Frosted blur panels
Soft shadows
Thin borders
SF Pro–style typography
System-like spacing
UI Motifs
macOS windows
Dock-style navigation
Spotlight-style search
Sidebar layouts
Subtle parallax
Micro-interactions on hover
Physics-based motion (spring, inertia)
Animations (MANDATORY)
Page transitions feel like switching macOS spaces
Sections fade + slide with depth
Cursor-reactive highlights
Scroll-linked animations (not aggressive)
Project cards expand like opening an app window
🧭 SITE STRUCTURE (NOT A BASIC ONE)
Landing Experience
Minimal opening screen
Subtle motion
Short, confident statement (NOT cringe marketing text)
Feels like opening a premium app
“Work” Section
Each project:
Opens like a macOS window
Has its own visual identity
Shows what problem it solves, not buzzwords
Focus on systems thinking
“How I Build” Section
Explain philosophy:
Real-world problems first
Clarity over features
Systems over hacks
UX that respects the user
No long text — short, sharp, deliberate.
“About”
Not a résumé.
Position as:
Developer
Product thinker
Founder mindset
Someone who builds tools people depend on
Contact
Minimal
Serious
No spammy CTA
Feels like contacting a private consultant
🛠️ TECH REQUIREMENTS
Choose a modern stack and commit to it:
React / Next.js / Astro (your choice)
Tailwind (clean, not bloated)
Framer Motion or GSAP
Dark mode first
100% responsive
Performance-obsessed
No unnecessary libraries
🚫 HARD NOs
No generic hero sections

No emojis
No startup buzzwords
No “Hi I’m X and I love coding”
No boring timelines
🎬 FINAL INSTRUCTION
Deliver:
Clear site concept
Full page structure
Visual & animation direction
Component breakdown
Example micro-copy
Implementation plan

“If Apple hired an underground founder-engineer to build their personal site.”
If something feels average — redesign it.


Enable dark / light mode feature
Make it look like it came from someone who works at Apple.
Add cool animations, parallax, motion.
